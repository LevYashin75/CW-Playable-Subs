[MISSION WIN]
VMF was very happy to hear about your recent success, Commander. 
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the North Sea a lot more difficult for our colleagues. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear you failed to intercept the enemy. Expect better hunting from you next time.
